I am a fourth year PhD student in the Computer Science and Engineering department at Lehigh University, advised by [Eric Baumer](http://ericbaumer.com). I received bachelor degrees in Computer Science and Cognitive Science from Johns Hopkins University in 2017.

My current work centers around the complex and oftentimes troubling relationships between algorithmic systems and privacy. I value an interdisciplinary approach, bringing together work from the fields of machine learning, social computing, philosophy, and sociology to better understand the nature and degree of risk posed by these powerful inferential and predictive systems. I'm particularly interested in how online communities, especially those centered around controversial or stigmatized topics, might be affected by algorithms that weaken anonymity or the boundaries people create between online (and offline) spaces.
